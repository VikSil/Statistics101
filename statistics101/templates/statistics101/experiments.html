    <p class="mb-1"><b>An experiment</b> is a study that imposes one or more treatments on the participants and controls
        their
        environment in such a way that clear comparisons [to lack of
        treatment] can be made. After the treatments are applied, the responses (i.e. effects or lack there off) are
        <nobr>recorded.{%spaceless%}{% if source_1 %}<sup>[<a target="_blank"

        </nobr> Contrary to
        observational studies, which aim to <b><i>not affect</i></b> the individuals that are being studied, experiments
        aim to <b><i>affect</i></b> them in order to study the consequence or degree of change. An individual
        participating in a study is called a <b>subject</b>. A <b>response</b>
        is the <a {% if 'qqdata' in navigation.data.links %} class="dark-link" href="{% url 'statistics101:qqdata' %}"
            {% endif %}>variable</a>
        whose
        outcome is of interest in the experiment. A <b>factor</b> is the variable
        whose effect on the response is being studied. A <b>level</b> is a possible outcome of the factor. Each factor
        has a certain number of levels. A <b>treatment</b> is a combination of the levels of the factors being
        studied. If there is only one factor, then levels and treatments are the same thing. If there are several
        factors, then each combination of levels of the factors is called a <nobr>treatment.{%spaceless%}

        <li><i><u>Making comparisons</u></i> - to establish the real effect that a factor has on the
            response, there has to be a baseline to compare to. This baseline is called the <i>control</i>. Without a
            control group there is nothing to compare the results to, and it is impossible to know
            whether the treatment was the real cause of any differences found in the response. Common
            methods for including control are to administer a fake treatment, a standard treatment or no treatment at
            <nobr>all.{%spaceless%}

            distinguishable from a
            "real" treatment. A placebo
            establishes a baseline measure for what responses would have taken place anyway, in absence of any
            treatment.
            It also takes into account the <b>placebo effect</b>- a response that people have (or report having) because
            they know they are getting some type of a "treatment" (regardless if it is real or fake). If placebo effect
            is not taken into account, any reported side effect has to be assumed to be due to the treatment. This would
            give an artificially high number of reported side effects, because at least some of those reports are likely
            due to the placebo effect and not the treatment itself. When there is a control group to compare with, the
            percentage of people reporting a side effect in the control group is subtracted from the percentage of
            people in the treatment group reporting the same side effect, allowing to examine the magnitude of the
            number

            treatment, the new treatment is compared to at least one existing or standard treatment that is known to be
            an effective treatment.
            In situations where the control group receives no treatment, researchers must make sure that the groups of

            In the setting of experiments, a sample means the
            group of subjects who have volunteered to
            participate. [In this sense the sample is not entirely random, because the subjects are
            self-selecting] However, statisticians can build techniques into the design of an experiment to help

            has
            been decided upon, the subjects
            should be divided into the treatment group and the control group randomly. Making random assignments of
            subjects to treatments is an extremely critical step towards minimising bias in an experiment. Subjects must
            be randomly assigned to groups by a third party and not allowed to choose which group they will be in. The
            goal of random assignment is to create homogeneous groups, where any unusual characteristics have an equal

        <li><i><u>Controlling for confounding variables</u></i> - a <b>confounding variable</b> is a variable or factor
            that was
            not controlled for in the study, but can have an influence on the results. Researchers try to control
            for as many confounding variables as they can anticipate, trying to minimise their possible effect on the
            response. In experiments involving human subjects, there are usually many confounding
            variables. Some, such as timing, can be controlled for in the design of the study. But others depend totally
            on the individual in the study. The ultimate control of subject-specific confounding variables is to use
            pairs of people that are matched according to important variables, or to just record responses from the same
            person twice:
            once with/after the treatment and once without/before. This type of experiment is called a
            <i>matched-pairs</i>
            <nobr>design.{%spaceless%}

        </li>
        <li><i><u>Respecting ethical issues</u></i> - some experiment designs that are theoretically possible are not
            ethical in practice. For example,
            forcing a subject to engage in a specific behaviour, such as smoking, to study adverse effects on
            health. It is only possible to study people with a particular condition and work backwards to see what
            factors may have caused it. But since it is impossible to control for historical confounding variables,
            singling out
            one particular cause becomes <nobr>difficult.{%spaceless%}
                {% if source_1 %}<sup>[<a target="_blank"

            Although causes of diseases can't be determined ethically by conducting experiments, new
            treatments
            can be tested using experiments. Medical studies that involve experiments are called <b>medical trials</b>.
            Serious experiments must pass an extensive series of tests that can take years to carry out. One reason the
            cost of prescription drugs is so high is the massive amount of time and money needed to conduct research and
            development of new drugs, most of which fail to pass the <nobr>tests.{%spaceless%}

        <li><i><u>Collecting good data</u></i> - there are three criteria when it

                href="{% url 'statistics101:qqdata' %}" {% endif %}>data</a> quality:
            <i>reliability</i>, <i>validity</i> and <i>absence of bias</i>. Data is reliable if it is possible to get
            repeatable results
            with subsequent measurements. Unreliable data comes from unreliable measurement instruments (such as poor
            calibration) or unreliable
            data collection methods (such as ambiguous questions). Data is valid if it measures what it is supposed to
            measure. Use of the appropriate measurement instrument is important. The data collected must be appropriate
            for the goal of the study. Data is <a {% if 'popsample' in navigation.data.links %} class="dark-link"
                href="{% url 'statistics101:popsample' %}" {% endif %}>unbiased</a> if it contains no systematic errors
            that either add or subtract
            from the true values. Biased data is such that systematically over-measure or under-measure the true results.
            Bias can be caused by instrument error, leading questions or preconceived expectations of the

            the study. The analysis has to legitimately and correctly answer the questions initially posed by the study.
