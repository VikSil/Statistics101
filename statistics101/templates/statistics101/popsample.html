    <p class="mb-1">For virtually any question you may want to investigate about the world, you have to focus on a
        particular group of individuals (for example, a group of people, a group of other animals, cities, rock
        specimens, exam scores etc.). The group of individuals being studied in order to answer research question is
        called a <nobr><b>population</b>.{%spaceless%}{% if source_1 %}<sup>[<a target="_blank"

            {% endif %}{%endspaceless%}</nobr> Studies don't
        usually have time or money to
        gather data on every single individual in a population.
        To find out something about a population, researchers select a subset of individuals from the population, study
        those individuals and use the information gathered to draw conclusions about the whole population. This subset
        of
        the population is called a <nobr><b>sample</b>.{%spaceless%}{% if source_1 %}<sup>[<a target="_blank"

    <p class="mb-1">A <b>parameter</b> is a single number that describes a population, for example, the median household
        income in a
        country. A <b>statistic</b> is a single number that describes
        a sample, for example, the <a {% if 'median' in navigation.stats.links %} class="dark-link"

        </nobr> The parameters of a population are usually unknown, so data is collected on a sample

    <h4 class="subtitle" id="bias">Sample size</h4>

    <p class="mb-1"><b>Sample size</b> is the final number of individuals
        in the study, the final size of <a {% if 'qqdata' in navigation.data.links %} class="dark-link"
            href="{% url 'statistics101:qqdata' %}" {% endif %}>data

        {% endif %}{%endspaceless%}</nobr>
        Sample size is commonly denoted by letter "<b>n</b>". Sample size
        is an important factor in determining the accuracy and
        repeatability of the <nobr>results.{%spaceless%}{% if source_1 %}<sup>[<a target="_blank"
                    href="{% url 'statistics101:sources' %}">{{source_1}}</a>,p.42]</sup>
            {% endif %}{%endspaceless%}</nobr> With a large population of thousands, it is the size of the sample, not
        the size of
        the population that
        determines the accuracy of the results. For example, a random sample of 1000 individuals, has the estimated
        accuracy level of 3,2 percentage points, no matter whether the sample is from a small town of 10 000
        individuals, a region of 1 million people or the entire <nobr>country.{%spaceless%}
            {% if source_1 %}<sup>[<a target="_blank"

            href="{% url 'statistics101:surveys' %}" {% endif %}>surveys</a> are based on
        large numbers of participants, but this isn't always true for other types of research, such as carefully
        controlled experiments. Because of the high
        cost of some types of research in terms of time and money, some
        studies are based on small number of participants. Researchers have to find the appropriate balance when
        determining sample <nobr>size.{%spaceless%}
            {% if source_1 %}<sup>[<a target="_blank"

    </p>

    <p class="mb-1">It is important to realize that sample results will vary from sample to sample. Statistical results
        based on
        samples should include a measure of how those results are expected to <nobr>vary.{%spaceless%}
            {% if source_1 %}<sup>[<a target="_blank"
                    href="{% url 'statistics101:sources' %}">{{source_1}}</a>,p.171]</sup>
            {% endif %}{%endspaceless%}</nobr> That is to say that samples themselves will have a distribution of
        possible results.
        Statistical results are evaluated by measuring their accuracy, typically through the margin of error. The
        <b>margin
            of error</b> reflects how much the results are expected to vary from sample to <nobr>sample.{%spaceless%}
            {% if source_1 %}<sup>[<a target="_blank"
                    href="{% url 'statistics101:sources' %}">{{source_1}}</a>,p.341]</sup>
            {% endif %}{%endspaceless%}</nobr>
    </p>

    <p class="mb-0"> The two most important ideas regarding sample size and margin of error are the
        <nobr>following:{%spaceless%}
            {% if source_1 %}<sup>[<a target="_blank"
                    href="{% url 'statistics101:sources' %}">{{source_1}}</a>,p.197]</sup>
            {% endif %}{%endspaceless%}</nobr>
    <ul>
        <li>Sample size and margin of error have an inverse relationship.</li>
        <li>After a point, increasing sample size gives diminishing return on increasing confidence level.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p class="mb-1">Having an inverse relationship means that as the sample size increases, the margin of error
        decreases. This
        relationship is called an inverse because the two move in opposite directions. The more information is gathered,
        the more accurate the results will be, given that the data is gathered and handled <nobr>properly.
            {%spaceless%}
            {% if source_1 %}<sup>[<a target="_blank"
                    href="{% url 'statistics101:sources' %}">{{source_1}}</a>,p.198]</sup>
            {% endif %}{%endspaceless%}</nobr>
    </p>

    <p class="mb-1">The relationship between the margin of error and sample size is non-linear, hence increasing the
        sample size has
        diminishing returns. For example, for the same confidence level of 95% and sample proportion pÌ‚=0.52, increasing
        the sample size from 500 to 1000 to 1500 and 2000 will decrease the margin of error from 4.38% to 3.10 to 2.53%
        and 2.19% respectively. The extra cost of increasing the number of data points (i.e. have more participants
        in the study, survey more people etc.) to achieve the small improvement of margin of error may not
        be worthwhile at some <nobr>point.{%spaceless%}

    <h4 class="subtitle" id="bias">Bias & Randomisation</h4>
    <p class="mb-1"><b>Bias</b> is the systematic favouritism [intended or accidental] of certain types or groups of
        individuals or
        certain <nobr>responses.{%spaceless%}{% if source_1 %}<sup>[<a target="_blank"

            {% endif %}{%endspaceless%}</nobr> If the method for selecting a sample data points from a population is
        biased,
        then the results will also be biased. Within the field of statistics it is not possible to measure bias; it is
        only possible to minimise it by
        designing good samples and <nobr>studies.{%spaceless%}

    <p class="mb-0">Some of the most common sources of bias <nobr>are:{%spaceless%}{% if source_1 %}<sup>[<a

    <ul>
        <li>Bad study design.</li>
        <li>Selection of a sample that does not represent the population of interest.</li>
        <li>Miscalibration of the measurement instrument.</li>
        <li>Lack of objectivity on the part of the researchers.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>


    <p class="mb-1">To minimise bias in a study the sample needs to be selected randomly. Sample selection is unbiased
        if every
        possible sample of equal size has an equal chance to
        be selected for the <nobr>study.{%spaceless%}{% if source_1 %}

        </nobr>
        To take an authentic random sample, a randomisation mechanism is needed to select the individuals. An example of
        random sampling involves the use of random number generators. In this process the items in the sample are chosen
        using a computer generated list of random numbers, where each sample of items has the same chance of being
        <nobr>selected.{%spaceless%}{% if source_1 %}<sup>[<a target="_blank"

            {% endif %}{%endspaceless%}</nobr>
        Note that in designing an <a {% if 'experiments' in navigation.data.links %} class="dark-link"
            href="{% url 'statistics101:experiments' %}" {% endif %}>experiment</a>,
        collecting a random sample of individuals to participate often isn't ethical because experiments impose a
        treatment on the <nobr>subjects.{%spaceless%}{% if source_1 %}<sup>[<a target="_blank"

            {% endif %}{%endspaceless%}</nobr>
        Such type of studies are conducted using subjects that volunteer to participate, they self-select. But
        randomness can be incorporated in experiments in a different way - by randomly assigning the subjects to the
        treatment group and the control group. If the groups are assigned at random, they have a good chance at being
        similar, except for the treatment they receive. That way, if a large enough difference is found in the outcomes
        for the groups, it can be attributed to the treatment, rather than to other <nobr>factors.{%spaceless%}

    </p>

    <P class="mb-1">Both the quality and the quantity of information is important in assessing how accurate a statistic
        will be. The
        more good data goes into a statistic, the more accurate that statistic will be. Small sample sizes make results
        less accurate (unless the population is small to begin with). However, more data isn't always better data - it
        depends on how well the data was collected. A small random sample with well collected data is much better than a
        large non-random sample with poorly collected <nobr>data.{%spaceless%}
